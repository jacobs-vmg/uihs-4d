September 20, 2021.

52
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.289
The I-10 Improvement Project
from FM 2434 to US 90 (Alleyton

53
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.099
Road South) is receiving
federal funds,

54
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.889
and because of the federal
component, TxDOT is required to

55
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.689
assess the potential
environmental effects of the

56
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.099
proposed project in accordance
with federal standards.

57
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.589
The process that is followed is
called the National

58
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.499
Environmental Policy Act
process, otherwise known as NEPA.

59
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.089
The NEPA process analyses of
the potential impacts to the

60
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.689
natural and manmade environment,
and helps the decision maker to

61
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.689
make an informed decision on
whether or not to proceed with

62
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.699
the project.

63
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.689
On December 9, 2019 TxDOT
received a sign Memorandum of

64
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.189
Understanding from the Federal
Highway Administration that

65
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.989
permits TxDOT to assume
responsibility from the Federal

66
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.289
Highway Administration for
reviewing and approving certain

67
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.699
assignments or projects.

68
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.699
This review and approval
process applies to this project.

69
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.489
The proposed project study
limits are along I-10 from FM

70
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.589
2434 to US 90 (Alleyton Road
South), which is approximately

71
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.079
six miles.Improvements include
improvements of the Business SH

72
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.789
71 Intersection with I-10
improvements to US 90

73
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.589
intersection with I-10, and a
realignment of the Colorado

74
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.699
River Bridge. The project is
located in Colorado County, Texas

75
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.279
The project setting in the City
of Columbus, and the towns of

76
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.599
Glidden and Alleyton on either
side of Columbus.

77
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.589
The Proposed I-10 Project is
needed due to the increased and

78
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.089
projected local and regional
growth, which is caused traffic

79
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.699
demand to exceed the capacity
of the roadway,

80
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.989
address design defiencies and
increased accident rates, and

81
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.389
to provide a safe and reliable
hurricane evacuation route for

82
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.199
the region.

83
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.489
The purpose of the Proposed
I-10 Project is to meet local

84
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.999
and regional future travel
demands by increasing capacity,

85
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.089
Improving the safety of the
roadway by correcting design

86
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.599
defiencies,

87
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.489
upgrading the facility to meet
current design standards, and

88
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.299
provide a safe and reliable
hurricane evacuation route.

89
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.899
The project started in 2018.

90
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.389
The proposed project was first
presented to the public and

91
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.299
September 2018

92
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.789
Following the public meeting,
the project design was revised

93
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.689
and refined to accommodate the
public needs within the project

94
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.789
corridor, as well as analyze
and address the potential

95
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.799
impacts to regulated resources.

96
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.189
A Notice of Oopportunity to
Comment was sent to affected in

97
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.689
adjacent landowners in February
2020 to discuss proposed design

98
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.399
changes.

99
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.689
Following that series of
meetings with local

100
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.199
stakeholders and elected
officials,

101
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.199
additional design modifications
were made.

102
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.489
Our project team updated
environmental and social impact

103
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.099
assessments from the proposed
new design.

104
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.389
The findings of these
assessments are presented at

105
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.789
this public hearing, along with
the preferred alternative for

106
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.999
public review and comments.

107
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.989
Now let's talk about daily
traffic volumes and level of

108
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.599
service along I-10,

109
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.999
what it is today, and what is
projected for the future.

110
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.989
Level of Service (LOS) is
Illustrated in the graphic on

111
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.219
this slide.

112
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.859
The Average DailyTraffic (ADT)
for

113
0:07:10.090 --> 0:07:15.706
I-10 within the proposed
project limits, was 43,310

114
0:07:15.706 --> 0:07:20.390
vehicles per day (or vpd) in 2018

115
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.089
And is projected to be seventy
thousand, seven hundred

116
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.699
vehicles per day by 2040

117
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.799
Level of service ratings range
from A,

118
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.999
free flowing traffic, as shown
in light green to F

119
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.899
which is heavily congested, as
shown in red.

120
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.289
In general, a level of service
A through D is considered

121
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.299
acceptable and a Level of
Service.

122
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.589
E or F is considered
unacceptable in terms of delays

123
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.599
experienced by the traveling
public.

124
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.499
The I-10 corridor from FM 2434
to US 90 (Alleyton Road South).

125
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.499
is currently functioning at an
average Level of Service C,

126
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.199
with limited points at Level of
Service D to E, in 2020,

127
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.999
Without improvements.

128
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.579
the 2045 No Build conditions
are projected to deteriorate to

129
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.199
Levels of Service ranging from
C to F.

130
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.289
The goal of the proposed
project is to improve mobility

131
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.099
to an acceptable Level of
Service.

132
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.689
The 2025 built alternative
Level of Service is anticipated

133
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.599
to be a Level of Service B,

134
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.489
and in 2045 build Level of
Service is anticipated to be an

135
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.999
average level of C.

136
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.189
The project team analyze crash
data for the project corridor

137
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.699
for the years 2016 through 2020.

138
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.389
In this time frame, a total of
750 crashes occurred within the

139
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.489
corridor, which is three times
higher than the state average

140
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.199
crash rate with an average of
two crashes per week.

141
0:08:55.900 --> 0:09:00.959
Seven crashes were fatal or
severe between 2017 and 2020

142
0:09:00.959 --> 0:09:05.888
and 17 serious injury crashes
occurred in the segment of I-10

143
0:09:05.888 --> 0:09:08.200
between 2016 and 2020.

144
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.299
To improve safety and reduce
crashes within the corridor,

145
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.199
a realignment of the Colorado
River Bridge

146
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.029
and it's approaches is
recommended

147
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.789
TxDOT, but is proposing to
reconstruct and widen the

148
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.789
existing foiling divided item
facility to a six-lane divided

149
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.489
facility with three twelve foot
wide mainlanes In each

150
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.599
Direction with 12-foot inside
and outside shoulders.

151
0:09:36.200 --> 0:09:39.728
The existing two-way frontage
roads would be converted to a

152
0:09:39.728 --> 0:09:44.007
one-way frontage road in each
direction, and will consist of

153
0:09:44.007 --> 0:09:48.167
two 12-foot lanes with
four-foot inside shoulders and

154
0:09:48.167 --> 0:09:51.540
eight-foot outside shoulders,
Two U-turn options

155
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.189
would be added for access and
to limit the distance between

156
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.499
turnaround options in the
corridor,

157
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.489
The roadway would maintain an
open ditch system along the

158
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.499
length of the proposed project.

159
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.789
The bridge over the Colorado
River would be reconstructed on

160
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.489
a new alignment as a six-lane
divided facility to improve

161
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.599
safety.

162
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.089
Improvements to the US 90
intersection are also proposed

163
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.599
to realign the intersection

164
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.189
Improvements to the Business SH
71 intersection at I-10 are

165
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.399
also planned.

166
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.699
The existing i-10 ROW

167
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.699
varies within the project
limits,

168
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.889
typically ranging from 324 feet
at its narrowest to 490 feet at

169
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.699
its widest,

170
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.799
averaging approximately 400
feet in width.

171
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.189
Approximately 84 acres of new
ROW would be required for the

172
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.499
proposed project.

173
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.789
The graphic shown above
illustrates the existing

174
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.399
typical section.

175
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.799
Within the proposed project
limits,

176
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.689
the roadway primarily consists
of a four-lane divided facility

177
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.489
with two 12-foot main lanes in
each direction and an open

178
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.299
ditch drainage system.

179
0:11:05.900 --> 0:11:10.148
The existing westbound mainlane
outside shoulders, are 11 feet

180
0:11:10.148 --> 0:11:13.300
wide and are designated as an
emergency evacuation lane.

181
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.889
The existing eastbound,
mainlane outside shoulders, are

182
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.289
an average of 10 feet wide.
Both eastbound and westbound

183
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.199
inside shoulders are four feet
wide.

184
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.089
Two, 11-foot-wide, two-way
frontage roads are adjacent to

185
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.799
the mainlanes in each direction.

186
0:11:31.800 --> 0:11:36.985
The existing ROW with ranges
from 324 feet at its narrowest

187
0:11:36.985 --> 0:11:45.120
to 490 feet at its widest
averaging approximately 400 feet.

188
0:11:47.300 --> 0:11:51.210
The graphic on this slide shows
the proposed typical section

189
0:11:51.210 --> 0:11:52.580
for the facility.

190
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.189
As noted earlier, the proposed
typical section would include a

191
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.689
six-lane divided facility with
three, twelve foot wide main

192
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.889
leads in each Direction and
12-foot wide inside and outside

193
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.499
shoulders.

194
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.889
The existing two-way frontage
roads would be converted to

195
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.289
one-way frontage roads in each
direction and would consist of

196
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.889
two, 12-foot lanes with four
foot inside shoulders with

197
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.999
eight-foot outside shoulders.

198
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.589
Two additional U-turn
overpasses would be added to

199
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.489
limit the distance between
turnaround options in the

200
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.299
corridor.

201
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.889
The roadway would maintain an
open ditch system along the

202
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.699
length of the proposed project.

203
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.789
The bridge over the Colorado
River would be constructed on a

204
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.089
new alignment as a six-lane
divided facility to improve

205
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.789
safety. Improvements to the US
90 intersection are also

206
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.699
proposed to realign the
intersection.

207
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.689
Improvements to the Business SH
71 intersection in Columbus are

208
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.599
also planned.

209
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:58.199
Approximately 84 acres of
additional ROW would be required.

210
0:12:59.990 --> 0:13:02.957
The schematic design plan and
profile sheets are available

211
0:13:02.957 --> 0:13:12.497
online at TxDOT.gov keyword
search, "I-10 from FM 2434",

212
0:13:12.497 --> 00:13:14.043
and at the in-person public
hearing option

213
00:13:14.044 --> 0:13:16.100
for detailed review.

214
0:13:18.390 --> 0:13:22.034
Here's a screenshot of the
legend for the schematics that

215
0:13:22.034 --> 0:13:23.530
you find on the website.

216
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.189
These legends are included on
each page of the schematic, so

217
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.869
you can reference it as you
review the schematics.

218
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.189
The screenshot on the right
shows a colors that build a

219
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.199
proposed design.

220
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.899
These colors identify the
limits in major aspects of the

221
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:38.809
project.

222
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.119
Let's walk through them.

223
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.899
The yellow color identifies the
main travel lanes on I-10.

224
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.519
The frontage roads are
identified in green.

225
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.299
In between main lanes and
frontage

226
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.789
road lanes will be areas of
blue which are entrance and

227
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.899
exit ramps.

228
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.089
Lastly, areas and dark orange
color identify bridges and

229
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.199
grade denotes existing pavement
to remain.

230
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.089
The screenshot on the left
shows the various types of line

231
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.799
that you'll see.

232
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.689
Of a particular note are the
black lines that outline the

233
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.279
main lanes,

234
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.899
the green lines that outline
frontage roads.

235
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.749
The thin orange dashed lines
indicate existing right-of-way,

236
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.419
and lastly, the thick blue
dashed lines indicate proposed

237
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.949
ROW.

238
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.889
The existing project corridor
does not contain sidewalks or

239
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.899
bicycle accommodations.

240
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.389
Bicycle use may be prohibited,
limited access or

241
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.399
controlled-access highways

242
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.229
within the state of Texas.

243
0:14:42.390 --> 0:14:47.044
The proposed I-10 facility is
not designed to accommodate

244
0:14:47.044 --> 0:14:49.867
pedestrian or bicycle
disabilities on the main lanes,

245
0:14:49.867 --> 0:14:52.565
or on the frontage roads
because of limited access

246
0:14:52.565 --> 0:14:56.781
points and safety concerns with
vehicles traveling at highway

247
0:14:56.781 --> 0:14:58.010
speeds.

248
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.289
Since the last public meeting
held in September 2018 to

249
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.149
present the project alternatives,

250
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.999
the following changes in
activities have occurred.

251
0:15:11.000 --> 0:15:15.129
The project limits have been
shortened approximately 10

252
0:15:15.129 --> 0:15:23.021
miles from SH 71 to FM 2761
(which were the old limits), to

253
0:15:23.021 --> 0:15:28.243
FM 2434 to US 90 (Alleyton Road
South), which are the new

254
0:15:28.243 --> 0:15:29.120
limits.

255
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.399
The proposed improvements to
the segment of I-10 from US 90

256
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.389
to FM 2761 where
environmentally cleared in

257
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.189
September of 2019. The proposed
ROW was decreased to

258
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.339
approximately 84 acres.

259
0:15:43.590 --> 0:15:46.689
And an Opportunity to Comment
was held in February 2020 to

260
0:15:46.689 --> 0:15:50.956
discuss the proposed design
changes with local elected

261
0:15:50.956 --> 0:15:55.760
officials as well as adjacent
and affected property owners.

262
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.688
The proposed project is
consistent with the State Rule

263
00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:04.899
Transportation Plan.

264
0:16:04.990 --> 0:16:07.632
The proposed project would be
funded with a combination of

265
0:16:07.632 --> 0:16:12.102
federal and state funds for a
total of approximately

266
0:16:12.102 --> 0:16:14.540
$272 million.

267
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.129
It is anticipated that the
first phase of construction

268
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.649
would begin in 2026

269
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.819
and take approximately three
years to complete.

270
0:16:27.100 --> 0:16:32.166
The proposed I-10 project would
be subject to final design

271
0:16:32.166 --> 0:16:36.415
considerations, require 84
acres of additional ROW in

272
0:16:36.415 --> 0:16:40.278
would potentially result in
three commercial displacements,

273
0:16:40.278 --> 0:16:43.200
which include two billboards
and a quarry.

274
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.069
The potential residential
structures

275
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.499
displacements may include three
ancillary ranch buildings and a

276
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.399
cistern at one location.

277
0:16:51.400 --> 0:16:54.973
Txdot offers relocation
counseling and financial

278
0:16:54.973 --> 0:17:00.049
assistance to residences and
businesses that are displaced

279
0:17:00.049 --> 0:17:01.660
by the acquisition of highway
ROW.

280
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.989
in accordance with the Uniform
Relocation Assistance in Real

281
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.399
Property Acquisition Policies
Act of 1970.

282
0:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.991
TxDOT would aid potentially
displaced businesses and

283
00:17:11.992 --> 0:17:13.220
residents.

284
0:17:13.220 --> 0:17:15.289

286
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.799
The project team identified and
evaluated the potential

287
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.389
environmental impacts that
could occur as a result of the

288
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.939
constructing the proposed
improvements.

289
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.139

Air Quality and Traffic Noise.

299
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.789
The project was designed to
avoid or minimize impacts to

300
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.699
the greatest amount practicable.

306
0:18:30.070 --> 0:18:32.000
Most of the project area
consists

307
0:18:32.000 --> 0:18:36.481
of urbanized habitats within the City of Columbus,

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.149
and outside of Columbus are
rural,

310
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.489
The project area contained
potential habitat for the

311
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.029
federally-listed Houston Toad.

312
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.989
Three years of Houston Toad
breeding season surveys were

313
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.599
concluded with no species, and
a finding of No Effect.

314
0:18:57.300 --> 0:19:00.001
The project area does not contain

315
0:19:00.001 --> 0:19:04.238
any suitable habitat, and it is not within the range 
of any

316
0:19:04.238 --> 0:19:06.860
other federally-listed, threatened or endangered species.

317
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.449
The project area is within
range for mussel Species for

318
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.099
Greatest Conservation Need
(SGCN).

319
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.189
Mussel Species Best Management
Practices, including surveys,

320
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.989
will be conducted prior to
construction.

321
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.829
For Community Impacts and
Environmental Justice:

322
0:19:26.830 --> 0:19:29.921
Long-term positive impacts are expected

323
0:19:29.921 --> 0:19:33.090
with improved traffic flow and safety, and reduced 
congestion.

324
0:19:33.090 --> 0:19:35.089
No adverse community impacts

325
0:19:35.089 --> 0:19:37.920
are anticipated with the proposed project.

326
0:19:37.920 --> 0:19:41.080
No disproportionately high nor
adverse impacts

327
0:19:41.080 --> 0:19:45.449
to The Limited English Proficiency (LEP) or
minority

328
0:19:45.449 --> 0:19:46.540
populations are anticipated.

329
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.128
And there are potential
displacements at four locations,

330
00:19:49.139 --> 00:19:53.029
including one residential
location and three commercial

331
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.439
locations.

332
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.919
For water resources,

333
0:19:59.930 --> 0:20:01.789
a Section 404 permit may be
required for

334
0:20:01.789 --> 0:20:06.020
impacts to Waters of the US, including wetlands.

335
0:20:06.020 --> 0:20:07.389
Coordination with the United
States Army

336
0:20:07.389 --> 0:20:10.490
Corps of Engineers is in progress.

337
0:20:10.490 --> 0:20:11.689
The proposed project would not

338
0:20:11.689 --> 0:20:14.378
increase the base flood elevation to a level that would
violate

339
0:20:14.378 --> 0:20:18.430
applicable floodplain regulations and ordinances.

340
0:20:21.100 --> 0:20:23.589
Potential concerns were found
during

341
0:20:23.589 --> 0:20:26.950
the Hazardous Materials initial site assessment process.

342
0:20:26.950 --> 0:20:29.063
However, these concerns were
resolved

343
0:20:29.063 --> 0:20:34.750
and no hazardous materials related action is
required for the project area.

344
0:20:37.000 --> 0:20:39.589
One archeological resource
eligible for

345
0:20:39.589 --> 0:20:42.978
listing on the National Register of Historic
Places

346
0:20:42.978 --> 0:20:46.490
may potentially be displaced for the proposed
project.

347
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.875
Additional archaeological
surveys would be conducted

348
00:20:49.876 --> 00:20:51.569
after ROW is acquired

349
0:20:51.570 --> 0:20:53.916
Mitigation for any cultural
resources

350
0:20:53.916 --> 0:20:57.256
impacted by the project would be coordinated

351
0:20:57.256 --> 0:20:59.090
with the Texas Historical Commission.

352
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.339
No historic structures are
properties

353
0:21:01.340 --> 0:21:04.592
eligible for listing on the
National

354
0:21:04.592 --> 0:21:09.570
Register of Historic Places would be impacted by the
proposed project.

355
0:21:10.750 --> 0:21:15.089
An analysis of section 4(f) and
6(f)

356
0:21:15.089 --> 0:21:18.178
properties determined the no parks and recreation areas
would be

357
0:21:18.178 --> 0:21:22.220
impacted in the proposed project area.

358
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.188
A traffic noise analysis was
conducted in accordance with

359
00:21:29.199 --> 00:21:31.909
state and federal guidelines.

360
0:21:31.910 --> 0:21:33.677
The traffic noise analysis
determine that out of 15

361
0:21:33.677 --> 0:21:37.657
representative receivers, 11

362
0:21:37.657 --> 0:21:42.094
locations were predicted to have noise levels that approach
or exceeded the

363
0:21:42.094 --> 0:21:45.318
FHWA noise abatement criteria under the

364
0:21:45.318 --> 0:21:50.360
Build Alternative; therefore the proposed project would
result in traffic noise impacts,

365
0:21:50.360 --> 0:21:51.489
None of the and tested

366
0:21:51.489 --> 0:21:54.560
noise barriers were both reasonable and feasible;

367
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.198
therefore, no abatement
measures are proposed for the

368
00:21:57.209 --> 00:21:58.099
project.

369
0:21:58.100 --> 0:21:59.989
The proposed project is

370
0:21:59.989 --> 0:22:03.478
included in the State Implementation Plan and would not

371
0:22:03.478 --> 0:22:06.700
adversely impact air quality in the region.

372
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.059
Here's a project process, and
next steps.

373
0:22:13.060 --> 0:22:15.342
This Virtual Public Hearing is
being held to

374
0:22:15.342 --> 0:22:20.470
present the Proposed Improvements to I-10
within the project limits,

375
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.999
changes in project design since
the last public meeting

376
0:22:23.000 --> 0:22:27.114
present the outcome of the
environmental

377
0:22:27.114 --> 0:22:30.380
analyses, and gather public and stakeholder
input.

378
0:22:30.380 --> 0:22:33.200
After the comment period closes,

379
0:22:33.200 --> 0:22:37.010
TxDOT will review the comments received and prepare a Virtual
Public Hearing

380
0:22:37.010 --> 0:22:38.720
summary report with comments,

381
0:22:38.720 --> 0:22:40.322
The summary report

382
0:22:40.322 --> 0:22:46.020
will be posted to the project website, approximately four months after
the close of the comment period.

383
0:22:46.020 --> 0:22:47.489
The next steps include

384
0:22:47.489 --> 0:22:51.177
finalizing the environmental analysis, including comments,
received at the

385
0:22:51.177 --> 0:22:52.990
Virtual Public Hearing,

386
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.309
Provided that the environmental
documents and process are

387
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.319
approved,

388
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.919
the project would then move
into the detailed design.

389
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.539
and ROW, acquisition could
begin.

390
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.459
As stated earlier, construction
is programmed to begin in 2026.

391
0:23:07.460 --> 0:23:09.389
The project team anticipates
that construction

392
0:23:09.389 --> 0:23:13.310
could take approximately three years.

393
0:23:15.900 --> 0:23:19.202
TxDOT encourages you to review
